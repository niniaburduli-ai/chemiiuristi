/** @module openrouter-stream-core
 *
 * Low-level SSE streaming client for OpenRouter's chat-completions endpoint.
 * Used by both the generic `ai-call.ts` helpers and the legal-specific
 * wrappers in `legal/openrouter.ts` — this is the ONLY place that talks HTTP
 * for streaming calls.
 *
 * Deliberately built on Node's core `https` module instead of `fetch` (which
 * the rest of this codebase uses for non-streaming OpenRouter calls). The
 * non-streaming path avoids upstream SSE specifically because holding/
 * aborting a long-lived stream socket on fetch's shared undici keep-alive
 * pool can poison that pool and stall unrelated requests. Using a completely
 * separate HTTP client (`https.request`) with a dedicated, non-keep-alive
 * `Agent` sidesteps that risk by construction: streaming sockets here never
 * share a pool with anything, and are closed (not returned to a pool) as
 * soon as each request ends.
